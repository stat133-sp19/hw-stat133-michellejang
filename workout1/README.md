**General Overview**

This project focuses on the shooting patterns of five players of the Golden State Warriors: Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Andre Iguodala. We take data collected from each of these individuals and create visualized shot charts by graphing the coordinates of each shot attempted and mapping those coordinates onto an image of the basketball court. We color-coded the points with whether the shot was made or not and utilized these graphs to evaluate shooting performances, patterns, and strategies for these players.

Then, we created tables detailing effective shooting percentages of each player with respect to their two-point, three-point, and general shots. We used these tables in conjunction with the shot charts to look furhter into how the success of the Golden State Warriors can be directly attributed to the shooting abilities and strategies of these five essential players and how those corresponding abilities drive the core of the team's dominance in offensive strategies.
