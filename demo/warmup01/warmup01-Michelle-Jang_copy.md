Cooking Recipe: **Blue Sky Bran Muffins**
-----------------------------------------

*Ingredients:*

-   1 1/3 cups of buttermilk
-   1 large egg
-   1/3 cup (80 ml) oil (such as vegetable, safflower, sunflower or olive oil)
-   1/4 cup (50 grams) lightly packed dark brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract, a little citrus zest (optional flavorings to add)
-   1 1/2 cups (90 grams) wheat bran\*
-   1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour
-   1 1/2 teaspoons (8 grams) baking powder (preferably aluminum-free)
-   1 1/2 teaspoons (8 grams) baking soda
-   1/4 teaspoon table salt
-   2 teaspoons (10 grams) granulated sugar, divided
-   3/4 to 1 cup chopped mixed fruit (just about anything but citrus or pineapple will work, they say; frozen berries are fine)

*Special Kitchen tools needed:*

-   muffin tin
-   nonstick spray
-   whisk

*Steps:*

1.  Heat oven to 425 degrees F and coat a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray.
2.  Whisk buttermilk, egg, oil, brown sugar and any vanilla or citrus zest you’d like to use in a small bowl. Whisk bran, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Stir wet mixture into dry until just combined and still a bit rough.
3.  Spoon two 2 tablespoons of batter into each prepared muffin cup. Add about 2 teaspoons fruit to each (dividing it evenly) and sprinkling the fruit with one of the teaspoons of granulated sugar. Spoon remaining batter (about 1 tablespoon each) over fruit and sprinkle tops of muffins with remaining teaspoon of granulated sugar.
4.  Bake muffins for a total of 16 to 18 minutes, rotating pan once midway through baking time for even browning, until a toothpick inserted into the center of muffins comes out with just a few crumbs attached. Do not overbake. Let muffins cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes before removing from tin.

### Wikipedia Page: Euclidean Distance

#### **Definition** \[edit\]

The **Euclidian Distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\\overline{\\mathbf{pq}})$.

In Cartesian Coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ...*p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ...*q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q}) = d(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2 + (q\_2-p\_2)^2 + \\cdots + (q\_n-p\_n)^2} \\\\ = \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i = 1}^n (q\_i - p\_i)^2}$$

The position of a point in Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$ ||\\mathbf{p}||= \\sqrt{p\_{1}^2 +  p\_{2}^2 +... p\_{n}^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p\\cdot p,}}$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
